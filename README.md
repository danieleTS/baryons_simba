Analyse baryonic effects on halos and large-scale structure in the Simba simulation


This repository contains the codes used to generate and plot the derived data from the
Simba cosmological simulation (Dave' et al., 2019), presented in the scientific article
"How baryons affect halos and large-scale structure: a unified picture from the Simba
simulation", by D. Sorini, R. Dave', W. Cui and S. Appleby, submitted for publication
to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society on 26th November 2021.

Some codes require the following Python packages to run:
- Caesar https://caesar.readthedocs.io
- yt https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ascl.soft11022T/abstract
- pygadgetreader https://github.com/dnarayanan/pygadgetreader
